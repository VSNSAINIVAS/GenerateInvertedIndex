Akbar and Birbal were taking a stroll in the king’s garden one pleasant morning. Akbar saw the crows in his garden and wondered how many crows there are in his kingdom. He posed the question to Birbal.
How many crows can you find in Akbar’s kingdom?
Birbal gave it some thought and said that there are ninety thousand two hundred and forty-nine crows in the kingdom. Akbar was amazed by his quick response and asked him, “What if there is a higher number of crows than the number you just mentioned?”. Birbal replied, “Then, crows from the neighbouring kingdoms must be visiting.” Then Akbar asked, “What if the number is fewer than what you mentioned?”. Birbal calmly replied, “Then, the crows must have gone on a vacation to the neighbouring kingdom.”

Moral: You can always find a way out if you think at ease.

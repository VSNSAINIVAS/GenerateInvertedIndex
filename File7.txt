One day, a rich merchant went to Birbal and complained to him that his house was robbed. He also told him that he suspects one of his servants to have robbed the house. Birbal went to the merchant’s house, rounded up all the servants and asked them who robbed the house. As expected, the robber did not come forward to confess his crime.
Birbal had come up with a way to find the culprit.
Birbal then handed a stick to each servant and told them that the robber’s stick will grow 2 inches longer the next morning. That way, they will be able to identify who robbed the merchant. The next morning, Birbal asked the servants for the sticks and pointed out the culprit to the merchant. The robber had reduced the length of the stick by 2 inches anticipating the stick to grow by the next morning. That’s how Birbal figured who the robber was.

Moral: No matter how hard you try, you can never hide the truth for long.

Among the many Akbar Birbal stories for kids, this one happens to be a favourite for both my kids!
